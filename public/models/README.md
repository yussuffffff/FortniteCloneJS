# Character Model Instructions

To get the character model for the game:

1. Go to [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com)
2. Download the Y Bot or X Bot character model
3. Add the following animations to the character:
   - Idle
   - Walking
   - Running
   - Jump
4. Download each animation in GLB format
5. Place the character model file as `male_character.glb` in this directory

For now, we're using a basic placeholder model until you add the proper character model.
